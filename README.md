# Survyay API Documents

In order to provide ease of access to the database for our Up in the Gunks project, I have created an api that when running, provides the team with all of the access they will need.

## Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. run a quick npm start to run and use this to access the database
